Developer Notes:
----------------
This was my first ever 'completed' game using Amulet
Amulet rocks, but there's a learning curve!
I used it for about a week years ago and got pretty far,
But using it again came with all kinds of hurdles, all over again!
But it was worth it!

Hope you enjoy the 'game'...
